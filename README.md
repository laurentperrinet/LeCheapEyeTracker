What is LeCheapEyeTracker ?
===========================

LeCheapEyeTracker is a framework to record eye movement with existing hardware -
focusing on speed rather than accuracy.

- EyeTracker: an method to record the orientation of your gaze in space, in
  particular on a computer screen where you show relevant information.
- Cheap: this depends on your definition of cheap, but it aims to use material you
  most certainly already have on your computer (a "webcam") or on some cheap hard-
  ware (such as a Raspberry Pi with the camera set). Most examples were tested on
  MacOs and the Raspberry.
- Le : because some comments in the code are still in french, so report any
  trace of baguette's crumbs.

For more information on how to install and use, see the ``dev`` folder.
